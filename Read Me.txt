Currently super beta

I had to use the docx from here http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ to get around a bug in the code.

Files
	build_mop:  Where all the work is done.  This looks for any port that is an access port and builds the config for them.  
	It also spits out the global config.
	These are gotten from cli_commands.

	IPs: A list of the devices you want to run this on
	
	doc_info:  A list of variables used to fill the MOP document.  I have been moving these out to their own files slowly.
	
	Objectives: The objectives for the MOP document
	
	Participants:  List of who is attending.
		1st colum is just bulited
		2nd colum is indented once
		3ed colum is indented twice
	
	cli_commands: Where it stores most of the config lines used 
		Beware the way it currently works is it spits out the data vlan between per-port config part 1 and 2.
		
	10.250.8.76 mop info.txt:  The commands that were spit out
	
	10.250.8.76 mop info.docx: The MOP that was spit out.

Current issues:
	Super beta!
	Need to make it work with multiple vlans (It currently assumes everything is on the same vlan)
	Need to keep moving info out of doc_info into specific files.
	Need to make the MOP prettier (Bold some stuff, and center to top part)
	Make it more modular
	Making this into classes would be great!
